  * Notes
    * **Optimize for learning**
      * Learning compounds over time
      * Invest in yourself by
        * reading books,
        * taking classes,
        * attending talks,
        * working on side projects
      * Ask youself:
        * How might you improve yourself every single day?
    * **Invest in iteration speed**
      * "I've found of people who were successful, almost all of them write a lot of tools." - Bobby Johnson, Former Engineering Director at Facebook
      * "If you have to do something manually more than twice, then write a tool for the third time." - Raffi Krakorian, Former VP Enginnering at Twitter
      * Ask yourself:
        * What are the events or the bottlenecks that you face during development?
        * How might you shorten a debugging workflow?
    * **Validate your ideas aggressively and iteratively**
      * Experiment-driven product design is a power tool
      * Ask youself:
        * How might you decompose your project into testable hypotheses?
        * How might you expend 10% of your effort upfront to validate that your project will work?
    * **Minimize operational burden**
      * "Do the simple thing first." - Mike Krieger, Co-Founder of Instagram
      * Beware the hidden costs of complexity
      * Sources of complexity
        * Code complexity
        * System complexity
        * Product complexity
        * Organizational complexity
    * **Build a great engineering culture**
